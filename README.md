Your Fortune
=======================

A program which, using the fortune_gem rubygem, generates fortunes to be printed on a BERG Cloud Little Printer. It is possible for the same fortune to be generated multiple times, but not within the same minute. This code is based on [lp_publication_hello_world](https://github.com/bergcloud/lp_publication_hello_world), and it was awfully poor form of me not to fork it then modify it. Bad Simon. Bad.

She runs real good on heroku, by the way.

Things of Note
===============

*The only routes written are /edition/ and /sample/, because those were the only ones necessary. I'm sorry if you were attached. They're gone now.
*There is no server at the index. This is entirely a backend endeavor, for now. I'll fix that in the next update.
*The estimated average cruising airspeed of an unladen European swallow is 25 miles per hour, according to WolframAlpha.
